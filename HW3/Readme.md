## HW3 - Discretization

Usage:

`python SuperDiscrete.py <filename>`

The input file by default is expected to have two columns. The first column containing the variable used for Unsupervised Descritizer and the second column for Supervised Descretizer. `UD_sample.txt` contains sample data in this format. To generate more random samples use:

`python UDiscrete_gen.py`

Executing the above script regenerates `UD_sample.txt` with a new set of samples
